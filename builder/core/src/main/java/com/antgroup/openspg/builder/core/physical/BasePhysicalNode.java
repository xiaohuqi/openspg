/**
 * Base class of physical execution nodes, initializes the physical execution node based on the
 * configuration of the logical execution node.
 *
 * <p>Currently, there are three types of physical nodes, namely data source nodes, processing
 * nodes, and sink nodes.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Data source nodes - Data source nodes are responsible for reading data from sources such as
 *       files, databases, graph stores, and so on.
 *   <li>Processing nodes - Process the data read from the data source, such as extracting
 *       structured data from unstructured text, standardizing non-standard field values, linking
 *       semantic type by semantic fields, and so on.
 *   <li>Sink Nodes - Sink nodes are used to output the build results to specific storage media,
 *       such as graph stores, search engines, and key-value stores.
 * </ul>
